Exercise 1

The data is now one big string, which makes it difficult to work with. You will have to parse it into a workable format.

Exercise 1.1
============
The data seems to have multiple orders, which are separated by a semicolon (;).

As the first step, create a list `orders_strings` where each entry is only the string corresponding to one order.

Exercise 1.2
============
Now that you have a list of order strings, it starts to look a bit more neat. However, how do you handle an individual
order and get insights from this?

As the next step in the data parsing, each element of the list should be a list itself. Make a new variable and name
it `orders_lists`.

Exercise 1.3
============
Great, each part of our list is now an individual order that we can use! The next issue pops up though: some names seem
to have some data corruption and they have some whitespaces before or after the name. See for example in our example
output above, that we have the name "Martin " and not "Martin" - this was not a typo ;)

As the next step, go through the list and remove the whitespaces from the start and end of names. Make a new variable
and name it `orders_cleaned`.

Exercise 1.4
============
Awesome work! The names now seem to be cleaned and we are ready to go. Or are we? If you take a better look, there is
another issue. Can you spot it...?

Indeed, the integers in the list also seem to be strings. This means that we cannot perform numerical operations on
them, so we need to transform (aka cast) them.

As the next step, go through the orders and make the age of the customer and the price of the hairstyle integer. Make a
new variable and name it `orders_casted`.

Of course, customers do not only get one haircut per year, so you expect to see some names in the data multiple times
(remember that we assume that the first name of a customer is unique).

Find the unique customers that the hairdresser has served. Put the unique names in a variable called `unique_names`, and
then print how many there are in and who they are in this format: "There are ... unique names, namely ..."

Exercise 4.5

Every year. the Institute of Statistics Netherlands (ISN) is doing research into the inflation trends in the
Netherlands. To do so, they collect data from as many hairdressers in the Netherlands as possible. Therefore, they have

Calculate the average price of a haircut and print the result in the following format:

The ISN finally publishes its research results on the inflation trends in the Netherlands of the past year. In the last
chapter of the research report, the hairdresser reads that the average inflation is 3.5%. This means that, on average,
the cost of living has increased by 3.5%. To compensate for this, the hairdresser wants to increase the prices of
haircuts by 3.5%; however, only for the working class. This way, juniors (<18) and seniors (>65) will not be affected.
The hairdresser wants to know want the impact on the revenue would have been last year if they had raised their prices
by 3.5% last year already.

Apply the price change of 3.5% on the working class and calculate the new revenue. Name this new revenue variable

to know if they can afford to give some discount to juniors and seniors without losing the extra revenue due to the
price increase on the working class. The hairdresser decides to give a 10% discount to juniors and a 5% discount
to seniors (while still applying the 3.5% price increase on the working class).

Exercise 5.1

The hairdresser is very happy with the data analysis so far and wishes to do this every year once the ISN research
results are out. To make this easier, the hairdresser would like to write a function that takes the list of orders as
input and returns the revenue. Write a function to do so. The function should be called `calculate_revenue` and takes
as input a list of orders and returns the total revenue.

Test the function on the original input, `orders_casted`, and see if you get the same revenue as calculated before

So far, so good! Now the hairdresser wishes to include a scaling factor as input to the function. This scaling factor
will be applied to all orders. The scaling factor will reflect a price decrease/increase. For example, for a price
decrease of 5% we would input `scaling_factor=0.95` to the function, and for a price increase of 5% we would input
`scaling_factor=1.05`. Write this function!

Test the function on the original orders, `orders_casted`, with scaling factor for an increase of 7.5% and print the
